# Overview

This project is a space shooter game developed to further my skills as a software engineer, specifically in game development using Unity. The game involves controlling a spaceship to shoot down enemies while avoiding obstacles. The player must navigate through waves of enemy ships, with each level increasing in difficulty as the enemies become more challenging.

The purpose of this software was to enhance my understanding of game design and development with Unity, including implementing graphics, sound, and user input handling. It also allowed me to practice structuring code using C# for game logic and utilizing Unityâ€™s features such as animations and physics.

To play the game, use the arrow keys to move your spaceship and press the mouse's left button  to shoot enemies. Try to survive as long as possible and score points by destroying enemy ships.

# Development Environment

The game was developed using the following tools:
- **Unity Engine**: For building the game, handling animations, and physics.
- **C#**: The programming language used to script the game logic.
- **Visual Studio**: For writing and testing C# code within Unity.
- **GitHub**: For version control and collaboration.

# Future Work

Here are some areas where the game could be improved in the future:
* Add a Boss with unique behaviors.
* Improve collision detection to make the game more responsive.
* Implement a power-up system to give players temporary abilities.
* Optimize performance for larger, more complex levels.
